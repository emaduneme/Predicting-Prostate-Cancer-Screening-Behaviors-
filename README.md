Prostate cancer remains a major public health burden, and promoting regular screening is crucial for early detection and improved outcomes. This study applied machine learning algorithms to a nationally representative survey dataset (Annenberg National Health Communication Survey, 2012) to determine the relative predictive power of various interpersonal and mass media communication factors on self-reported prostate cancer screening behaviors.
